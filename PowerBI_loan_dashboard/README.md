# Loan Default Dashboard — Power BI

![Dashboard preview]https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LQ6K2btVSYdnPWpbkuo535gk4AIpgOCg

An interactive Power BI report that explores **4,436 consumer-loan records** and pinpoints risk drivers behind a **20.9 % default rate**.  
It forms one of three projects (Excel • Python • Power BI) in my finance-analytics portfolio.
